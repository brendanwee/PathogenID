The beginnings of our group project for Prgramming for Scientists at CMU.

PathogenID is a software package aimed at taking raw illumina sequencing data of Tuberculosis as input and providing detailed variant calls on key genes to assess antibiotic resistance. The goal is to create a hassle free, user friendly pipeline with clear data visualization to provide an actionable clinical response from sequencing data in real-time.
